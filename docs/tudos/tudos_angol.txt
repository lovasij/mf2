Paul Baran:
He was born on April 29, 1926 in Grodno (then in the Second Polish Republic, part of Belarus since 1945)
Died March 26, 2011 (aged 84)
Joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran set out to design a "survivable" communications system
Using computing technology of the day, Baran and his team developed a simulation simulation to test the appropriate connectivity of an array of nodes with varying degrees of connectivity.
After proving survivability, Baran and his team had to show proof of concept for the design so it could be built. It includes high-level schematics detailing the operation, construction, and cost of all the components needed to build a network that uses new insights into redundant connections. The result is one of the first storage and transport data layer switching protocols, a contact face/distance vector routing protocol, and an unproven connection-oriented transport protocol. The plans are detailed in the On Distributed Communications series of reports published by RAND in 1964.
After On Distributed Communications was published, he presented his team's findings to a variety of audiences, including AT&T engineers. In later interviews, Baran mentioned that AT&T engineers scoffed at his idea of ​​non-dedicated physical circuits for voice communications, at times claiming that Baran simply did not understand how voice communications worked.
In 1969, when the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) began developing the idea of ​​a networked set of terminals for sharing computing resources, reference materials included Baran and the RAND Corporation's On Distributed Communications. [3] The resiliency of packet-switched networks using link-state routing protocols used on the Internet stems in part from research into developing a network that can survive a nuclear attack.
In 1968, Baran was the founder of the Future Institute, and later participated in other networking technologies developed in Silicon Valley. He has written on the subject of computer systems and privacy. Baran participated in the revision of the NBS data encryption standard proposal in 1976.
In the early 1980s, Baran founded PacketCable, Inc "to support pulsed pay television, locally generated videotex and packet voice". PacketCable, also known as Packet Technologies, spun off from StrataCom to commercialize its packaged voice technology in the telephone market. This technology led to the first commercially available pre-standard asynchronous transfer mode product.
He founded Telebit after creating its discrete multitone modem technology in the mid-1980s. It was one of the first commercial products to use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, which was later widely used in DSL modems and Wi-Fi wireless modems.
In 1985, Baran founded Metricom, the first wireless Internet company, which introduced Ricochet, the first public wireless mesh network system. In 1992, he also founded an early cable modem company called Com21. After Com21, Baran founded and chaired GoBackTV, which specializes in personal television and cable IPTV infrastructure equipment for television providers. He later founded Plaster Networks, which offers an advanced solution for connecting home or small office network devices over existing wiring.
